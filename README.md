# ASCalc
C# console application that evaluates a string expression consisting of
non-negative integers and the + - / * operators only, taking into account the normal
mathematical rules of operator precedence. Support for brackets is not implemented.

For example:
an input string of "4+5*2" should output 14
an input string of "4+5/2" should output 6.5
an input string of "4+5/2-1" should output 5.5
